# ℹ️ About Pages

Pages are the backbone of any website.\
\
Pages in Siteglide are Liquid files in the codebase and rendered to HTML before the server delivers that Page to the browser. Liquid files can also include HTML. This allows the server to deliver some content dynamically, or some HTML statically.

When some content is very similar on multiple Pages, we recommend using [Page Templates](/cms/pages/page-templates/README.md) to reduce repetitive code, save time and make maintenance easier.

## Types of Pages

* Standard Pages are created by you and can include any kind of Liquid or HTML code.

Some Pages are generated dynamically by the System:

* Detail Pages are dynamically generated by the system to output database items from WebApps and Modules front end.
* System Pages are similar to ordinary Pages, but are accessed in a different area in CLI and Admin to acknowledge their special functional role in the site, for example password reset pages.
