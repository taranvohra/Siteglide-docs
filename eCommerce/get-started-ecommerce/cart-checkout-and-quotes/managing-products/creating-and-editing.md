Adding a Product is very similar to adding a WebApp item, but with additional features which are fully integrated into other features of Siteglide eCommerce e.g. Shopping Cart, Checkout and Orders.

# Creating A Product

Firstly, navigate to your Products.

On the right-hand side above your list of Products, you'll see a blue button that says 'Add New Product', click this and you'll be on your way to creating a new Product.

This will redirect you to 'Standard Fields' page. 

Once you have filled out these fields, click 'Save'.
Your new Product will then show in your list of Products.

# Edit A Product

Whilst viewing your list of Products, click on the Product name, or the pencil icon to the right-hand side of any existing Product to take you to the Standard Fields page.
