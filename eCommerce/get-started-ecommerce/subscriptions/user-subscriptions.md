# User's Active Subscriptions

This Article shows you how to use the Secure Zones Layout user\_subscriptions to List Subscription Orders belonging to a User.

## Introduction

This article shows you how to use the Secure Zones Layout user\_subscriptions to List Subscription Orders belonging to a User. As this is a Secure user-specific List, the Layout is found in the Secure Zones Module.

This is slightly different from a Subscriptions List view, as this lists all available Subscription products- you can [learn more here](subscriptions-list.md).

## Outputting the user\_subscriptions List

The following Liquid can be outputted on any Page protected by a Secure Zone:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{%- include 'user_subscriptions', layout: 'default' -%}
{% endraw %}

```

Parameters:

* `layout` - Select a Layout for this view.

## The user\_subscriptions Layout

### File Structure

You can find these Layouts at the path: `layouts/modules/module_5/user_subscriptions/`

### Development

#### Looping over Subscription Orders

To loop over available Subscription Orders, you can use the following Liquid:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% for this in subscription_orders %}

{% endfor %}
{% endraw %} 

```

Inside the loop, you can use the available fields shown below under the `this` namespace. Outside of the loop Liquid, you can build the HTML structure which will wrap your Layout.

#### Setting a Subscription to Cancel at the end of the Billing Period

You can use the following Liquid to include a button to either cancel a Subscription or stop a pending cancellation. Read more here.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{%- if and this.cancel_at_period_end != 'true' -%}         
  {%- include 'ecommerce/subscription_cancel', orderID: this.id -%}
{% elsif this.cancel_at_period_end == 'true' %}
  {%- include 'ecommerce/subscription_reactivate_cancelled', orderID: this.id -%}
{%- endif -%}
{% endraw %}

```

_Tip: Changes in the Pricing Plan_ It's possible to change the price and billing interval of a Subscription. This change will only affect new subscribers and existing customers will continue on the plan they signed up for originally. You can read more about this here: [eCommerce Subscriptions - Changing the Price and Billing Interval](managing-subscriptions/changing-price-and-billing-interval.md)

When outputting fields in the `user_subscriptions` view, Subscription Order fields beginning with the word "Plan" will normally be the appropriate choice. These will show the price that these Users will be paying- the original plan when they signed up.

The other Price and Interval fields stored against the Subscription, could be used to show how much the User is saving on their current plan compared to the current price. In the different context of the [Subscription Detail Page](subscriptions-detail.md)- we give a different recommendation as here it may not always be possible to identify immediately if the User is subscribed to a different plan.

_Tip: Working with the Interval Fields_ As you can see below, there are multiple fields involved in storing the Interval of charges, which you can use to display the Interval in a user-friendly way. Here's one example of using Liquid to programmatically decide the format to display the Interval:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% if this['Interval Count'] == "1" %}
per {{this['Interval'] | pluralize: 1}}
{% else %}
(every {{this['Interval Count']}} {{this['Interval']}})
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
```

If the Interval Count is 1, it will use formatting like "per day".

If the Interval Count is greater than 1, it will use formatting like "every 2 days".
