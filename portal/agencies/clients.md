# 👩‍💻 Clients

The Clients feature in Portal is only available to Agencies and gives you an extra level of management allowing you to group multiple Sites under one Client and control who can see it.

## Create Client Companies

You can create unlimited Clients and Invite Users who would then only have access to that Client area and any Sites linked to it.

You can access this from the left hand side menu but also from within your Agency Account.

## Invite & Manager Client Users

If you invite a User within a Client they only have access to that Client Company and any Sites within it. It's very useful when a customer has multiple Sites but it's also a good way to keep Siteglide organised and clutter free!

## Create & Manage Client Sites

The Sites tab shows the Sites linked to this Client Company. Create a new Site here to ensure it can only be seen by the right Clients (your Agency users can see ALL sites):
