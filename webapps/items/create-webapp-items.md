# 📋 Create WebApp Items

Once we’ve created our WebApp, it’s time to start creating items. This enables us to add services, recipes, store locations, images for our gallery and so much more to our site.

## Creating And Editing Items <a href="#id-2-creating-and-editing-items" id="id-2-creating-and-editing-items"></a>

You can create unlimited items without writing any code, simply fill in the fields.

* **ID / External ID** - Unique identifiers for each item, these appear when you have created and saved a new item and they cannot be edited.

### SEO Settings <a href="#id-2-seo-settings" id="id-2-seo-settings"></a>

Navigate to the next tab along, this is called "SEO"

{% hint style="info" %}
If the SEO tab isn't showing it's because this WebApp doesn't have a Detail View.

SEO and Open Graph fields are the same across all WebApps and help to enhance your items and your website, achieving higher rankings.

These fields include:

### Custom Fields <a href="#id-2-custom-fields" id="id-2-custom-fields"></a>

Navigate to the third tab along, this is called "Custom Fields".

Any custom fields added to your WebApp will show here for you to utilise.These can be filled in, if required, or left blank for later editing.

You can also toggle to show the custom field IDs; these can come in handy for outputting in layouts. You can instead choose to output the quick liquid provided from the dropdown in Code Editor.

### Adding Items to Categories <a href="#id-2-adding-items-to-categories" id="id-2-adding-items-to-categories"></a>

Navigate to the fourth tab along, this is called "Categories".

With a list of available Categories, you can open top levels to show the children categories.

You can choose to add an item to any parent or child category.

**No categories showing?** Use ‘Manage Categories’: where you can create, edit and remove any.

### Securing Items <a href="#id-2-securing-items" id="id-2-securing-items"></a>

Navigate to the fifth tab along, this is called "Secure Zones".

{% hint style="info" %}
If the Secure Zones tab isn't showing it's because making items secure has not been enabled in the WebApp settings.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Siteglide-WebApps-Secure-Zones-Settings.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

With Secure Zone options set up in your WebApp Builder, you can use the dropdown to add any existing secure zones on your site to this item.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Siteglide-WebApps-Item-Secure-Zones.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Alternatively, backspace or “x” can remove any unwanted secure zones.

If no Secure Zones are available to add, you can create some:

{% content-ref url="../../modules/core-modules/secure-zones/" %}
[secure-zones](../../modules/core-modules/secure-zones/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

***

### Adding A Location <a href="#id-2-adding-a-location" id="id-2-adding-a-location"></a>

Navigate to the sixth tab along, this is called "Location".

Using “Search for an Address” to find one, manually enter an “Address” or use “Longitude/Latitude” coordinates for GeoJSON, you can enter one location to be added to this item.

For example, this could be a Services WebApp with training locations, or Galleries showcasing hot vacation spots.

This can be shown on the front-end as a list, or in a map with drop pins.

{% content-ref url="../layouts/searching-by-location.md" %}
[searching-by-location.md](../layouts/searching-by-location.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Item History <a href="#id-2-item-history" id="id-2-item-history"></a>

Navigate to the seventh tab along, this is called "Item History".

Here, you can view and restore different versions of this WebApp item from the last 7 days.

You can view when this version was created, by who, what action was taken, and a choice to view more information about this change and rollback.

### Copy Items <a href="#id-2-copy-items" id="id-2-copy-items"></a>

Duplicating items allows you to easily replicate items across your Site and have an item with different URLs.

Once you have one item set up, you can duplicate this many times to create the number of items you need or duplicate once to set up a similar item without manually creating these.

You can do this by clicking ‘Copy item’ at the bottom of any item.
