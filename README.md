# 👋 Welcome

Siteglide allows agencies to take control over code and data via API, CLI or UI. With the right blend of out-of-the-box tools and freedom to develop - without limits.

## Where do I start?

If you're new to Siteglide we recommend starting from a pre-built Template that leverages our SiteBuilder tool: [create-site-from-template.md](sitebuilder/setup-sitebuilder/create-site-from-template.md "mention").

If you're already working on a site and you're code savvy we strongly recommend setting up our CLI so you can get the most from Siteglide via VSCode or your preferred IDE: [quickstart.md](developer-tools/cli/quickstart.md "mention")

If you're looking for help with a site and not sure where to look you can check out our [tutorials.md](get-started/tutorials.md "mention").&#x20;

Alternatively use the Search (top right) or navigate through the left menu which is organised to match the menu you will see in Siteglide.
