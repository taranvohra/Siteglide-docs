# 💡 About Building Modules

Building Modules could be the perfect way to keep your workflow "DRY" (don't repeat yourself)! If you find a common requirement on more than one site, and no-one is currently offering a solution, or you think you can build a better one, building Modules might be for you.

## What Skills do I Need?

For some types of Module, anyone can have a go, for example building a Site Template could be done by a Designer with a little bit of HTML and CSS knowledge:

{% content-ref url="../siteglide-modules-marketplace/site-template-modules-and-how-to-make-your-own.md" %}
[site-template-modules-and-how-to-make-your-own.md](../siteglide-modules-marketplace/site-template-modules-and-how-to-make-your-own.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

For other kinds of Module, we recommend getting hold of a developer. If you don't have one, check out Sitegurus who can provide this service.

## Getting Started

## To Publish or Not?

One way to start building Modules is to build them as an internal tool for your Agency. This doesn't require any approval from Siteglide.&#x20;

Or, you can publish your Module on the marketplace. This requires Siteglide approval so we can check the module is transparent about the kind of code it runs. You can either:

* Make the Module Open-Source&#x20;
  * You can either all Siteglide users access, or require them to contact you before you decide whether to give their organisation access
  * You can optionally allow others to contribute to your Github repository
* or Accept Payments
