## How the Tutorials Work

These GraphQL tutorials are organised by topic, but we'd recommend you work through them one by one.

This is because each tutorial will build upon the skills covered in previous ones.

We also include challenges- because when learning something like GraphQL it always helps to get hands-on experience exploring and applying the skills you've picked up. Don't worry if you can't quite manage the challenges straight away. Give them your best shot and then check the answer pages.
