# 🚀 Getting Started: Forms

Forms are extremely versatile on Siteglide and can be used in a number of ways, such as:&#x20;

* Including standard fields for collecting one-off information, we call this a "case"
* Including groups of fields, called Custom Field Sets
* Collecting information about customers to be stored in the CRM, which will update previously collected data as well as store a snapshot of the submission in the case.
* Signing users up to a Secure Zone
* Collecting eCommerce Payments
* Running an automation
  * Sending a workflow, autoresponder or custom email
  * Carrying out a custom automation action
  * Sending an API call

You can use "capchas" to prevent spam submissions on forms.&#x20;
