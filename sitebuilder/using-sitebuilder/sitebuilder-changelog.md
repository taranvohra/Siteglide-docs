# üóìÔ∏è SiteBuilder Changelog

## About SiteBuilder updates and backwards compatibility <a href="#about-sitebuilder-updates-and-backwards-compatibility" id="about-sitebuilder-updates-and-backwards-compatibility"></a>

### Summary <a href="#summary" id="summary"></a>

* Always install updates to the main SiteBuilder Module before any Themes
* SiteBuilder updates won't overwrite your site code
* Uninstalling the SiteBuilder module may cause some code to stop working.
* Presets (for Tailwind Themes), JavaScript files and Liquid functions will use a folder based versioning system, so you can choose whether to continue or upgrade.

### In Detail <a href="#in-detail" id="in-detail"></a>

We're always adding to SiteBuilder and its associated Theme Modules. However, it's important to us that changes to this module do not cause you problems on your site.

Therefore, we never change the layouts on your site during an update. We only update the "master copy" of the layout in the module. That means brand new layout installs from the module will have updates, while older layouts will continue to function as before.

There are exceptions to this rule, for example Liquid includes which power functionality like dynamic forms. In these cases, we will only modify these files with non-breaking changes. For breaking changes, a new version of the file will be created and linked to new layouts, leaving the old version continuing to function with existing layouts.

Another exception of sorts is the contents of the `marketplace_builder/assets/modules/module_86/src/open_me_to_set_up_tailwind_1st_time` folder. This will not receive updates since this is only meant to be a template to get you setup and we don't want to encourage different developers on a project to set up differently. Instead, see [example-tailwind-project-setup.md](../setup-sitebuilder/styling/example-tailwind-project-setup.md "mention") for the recommended setup, which you can use to update if you choose- it may be important to update to get access to certain features like presets, but not for everyday use.

For the optimum compatibility, we recommend always making sure the main SiteBuilder module is up to date before updating any SiteBuilder Theme modules. Some Theme module updates may rely on the latest version of SiteBuilder.

## Releases <a href="#releases" id="releases"></a>

### 4.18.1-5 - Released November 22nd 2024

* Patches for Theme Presets. Thanks for the feedback so far, we have patched several issues. The major patch addresses a known issue in the Flowbite plugin, where it was impossible for a preset to override any existing colours defined by the Flowbite plugin. This has been addressed by a temporary fork of the Flowbite plugin, which will receive a permanent fix by Flowbite in the next major version, co-inciding with Tailwind version 4.
  * In order to receive this update, after updating the module, make sure to update a tailwind.config.js file's `require('flowbite/plugin')` to `require('flowbite/../../modules/module_86/public/assets/css/presets/flowbite_plugin_fork_colors_disabled')`
  * Added new documentation [example-tailwind-project-setup.md](../setup-sitebuilder/styling/example-tailwind-project-setup.md "mention")
* We've also added a range of static and dynamic layouts to Flowbite with a more generous use of primary and secondary background and text colour utility classes. This will allow them to make better use of the preset you select and override with your own colour scheme:
  * New Form Layout with floating labels
  * New Testimonials Layout
  * New FAQ layout
  * New Menu Layouts
  * New Webapp Layouts
  * Hero, pricing, feature static layouts

### 4.18.0 - Released November 15th 2024

* [Theme Presets](../setup-sitebuilder/styling/theme-presets-coming-soon.md) released for the Flowbite Theme - we'll talk about these a lot more in the coming days. In short, presets are a set of defaults for your Tailwind Config which set default colour, font and much more! You can switch preset to completely change the look of your site while keeping the HTML untouched. To start with we're releasing the following:
  * Gardening Preset
  * MNTNs Preset
* New layouts to be released alongside the presets which are fully compatible with the Flowbite Theme but have come from other designers' open-source work. These make a more generous use of both primary and secondary colour variables.
* Structured Data added to the following Detail layouts for better SEO:
  * Authors
  * FAQs
  * Events

### 4.17.2 - Released October 25th 2024

\+ Flowbite Pro Version 1.9.4

  * FAQ List
  * Events List
* 2 New Blog Detail Layouts
* 2 New Form Layouts
* New Accordion WebApp Layout
* Original Blog Detail Layout updated with new features (will roll out to other Blog layouts soon):
  * Google Structured Data Support
  * Support for visiting URL with ?edit=true at end of URL to display edit form (after permission checks). This goes nicely with the Admin Tables which can link to it.
* Updated many modals to be "static" to prevent accidental closing

### 4.17.1 - Released October 2024

* Support for new Pro layouts in Preview Mode
* Removed console errors for Live Updates which were unnecessary (logs not errors).

### 4.17.0 - Released 24th September 2024

* Tailwind build method can now be overridden on the Page Template level, either by setting when you create a Page Template, or by using the `template_build_method` parameter (can be set to either "cli" or "preview"):

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include 'modules/module_86/tailwind/head', template_build_method: 'cli', template_build_me optional_path_to_cli_css: '' %}
{% endraw %}


```

* New Preview build method for Tailwind. This is a replacement for the now deprecated JIT option, which should provide faster development times.
  * Preview mode is designed to load CSS fallbacks so that any Flowbite blocks added to the site will be supported out-of-the-box, using Flowbite default variables.
  * It can be used alongside a CLI build. The CLI build will override any classes you've used, with branded versions of the variables you've set in your Tailwind Config file, while continuing to fallback to Flowbite defaults when brand new blocks are added.
* New Static Layouts for Flowbite:
  * Portfolio
  * Promotional Section

* Updated Layouts generally to support latest version of Flowbite v.2.3.0 and Tailwind CSS 3.4.3. To get the benefit of newer Flowbite JS, you will need to update the `<script>` tag in any SiteBuilder-built Page Templates. When testing the Site Templates, we didn't find many compatibility issues- the main one was a change in syntax for Flowbite Modal components. Please report any you find which can be fixed on our end.
* Updated the Sitegurus Tailwind Template with these newer versions of Flowbite and Tailwind CSS. [https://github.com/SiteGurus/Siteglide-Tailwind-Template](https://github.com/SiteGurus/Siteglide-Tailwind-Template) You can update your existing CLI setups using NPM

* Live Updates 1-4 hotfix - [changelog](live-updates-api/live-updates-changelog.md)

#### 4.9.1 - Released 15th February 2024 <a href="#id-491-released-15th-february-2024" id="id-491-released-15th-february-2024"></a>

* Hotfix for form layouts not working with the minified version of JavaScript files. This issue would only have affected more recent installs.

#### 4.9.0 - Released 21st December 2023 <a href="#id-490-released-21st-december-2023" id="id-490-released-21st-december-2023"></a>

* Support for upcoming eCommerce features- including new version of [Live Updates 1.4](live-updates-api/live-updates-changelog.md).

#### 4.8.12 + 4.8.13 - Released 11th December 2023 <a href="#id-4812-4813-released-11th-december-2023" id="id-4812-4813-released-11th-december-2023"></a>

* Support for upcoming eCommerce features

#### 4.8.10 + 4.8.11 - Released 4th October 2023 <a href="#id-4810-4811-released-4th-october-2023" id="id-4810-4811-released-4th-october-2023"></a>

* Fix for broken links in the SiteBuilder UI

#### 4.8.9 - Released 27th September 2023 <a href="#id-489-released-27th-september-2023" id="id-489-released-27th-september-2023"></a>

#### 4.8.8 - Released 14th September 2023 <a href="#id-488-released-14th-september-2023" id="id-488-released-14th-september-2023"></a>

* Live Updates v1-3
  * New version of [Live Updates 1.3](live-updates-api/live-updates-changelog.md). Existing layouts can be updated by manually changing the `<script>`. New layouts will use the new version.
* Performance
  * All SiteBuilder JS, including Live Updates, now has a minified version of the same file in the same folder. Simply replace `.js` with `.min.js` extensions for a performance boost. This will be applied to new installs of layouts going forwards. If you're experiencing unhandled JS errors and want to report a bug, you may find it helpful to switch back to the unminified version temporarily.
  * Performance boost to the SiteBuilder module UI

#### 4.8.7 - Released 9th September 2023 <a href="#id-487-released-9th-september-2023" id="id-487-released-9th-september-2023"></a>

*   Forms

    * Datasources in forms used to only show a maximum of 20 options. A lower value may have increased performance, but also reduced the user's choices arbitrarily. Now that limit has been increased to 2000 by default on both dynamic and static form layouts. You can change the default on dynamic layouts by setting a `datasource_limit` parameter to a string value e.g. `'1000'` on the `form_layout_fields` include. On static layouts, the `per_page` parameter can be edited on the nested \`\`\`liquid

    \{% include %\}

    ```tags
    ```
*   Cookie Popup Layouts

    * Fixed bug preventing some layouts from hiding scripts when cookies rejected. Remember changes will only apply to freshly installed layouts. If you need to fix an existing layout manually, replace:

    ```liquid

    {% raw %}
    {% if context.exports.company_information.properties.google_analytics_id != blank and context.exports.sitebuilder.cookie_preferences_js == 'all' %}
    {% endraw %}

    ```

    with:

    ```liquid

    {% raw %}
    {% if context.exports.company_information.properties.google_analytics_id != blank and context.cookies['sg-cookie-policy-settings'] == 'all' %}
    {% endraw %}

    ```
* Live Updates
  * Added support for using a code\_snippet or content\_section as your layout. A new parameter of `include_id` has been added to the `live_updates_params_encode` include to store the ID of the `code_snippet` or `content_section`. See: [Defining a Live Update Layout](live-updates-api/steps-to-setting-up-live-updates-api-in-a-module-webapp-layout.md#id-2-defining-a-layout-which-will-liveupdate-and-automatically-generating-a-public-api-key)

#### 4.8.6 - Released 9th August 2023 <a href="#id-486-released-9th-august-2023" id="id-486-released-9th-august-2023"></a>

* New version of [Live Updates 1.2](live-updates-api/live-updates-changelog.md)

#### 4.8.5 - Released 3rd August 2023 <a href="#id-485-released-3rd-august-2023" id="id-485-released-3rd-august-2023"></a>

* Fixed bug in Page Template install in Themes with no cookie popup option
* Fixed bug in Live Updates error handling

#### 4.8.4 - Released 25th July <a href="#id-484-released-25th-july" id="id-484-released-25th-july"></a>

* Improved PageBuilder Options. You can now set custom pagination layouts in PageBuilder in the options drawer.
* Improvement to WebApp table layout so that if a category filter is added, it's possible to choose a parent category in a Liquid variable at the top of the wrapper. This means you can organise relevant categories in a folder and only show those.
* Improvement to Blog layouts using a grid where if few results, the cards would stretch to fill the space. Now they stay at the correct unstretched size.
* Blog, Events, FAQ and other list layouts replaced with upgraded Live Updates versions of themselves, for better user experience. When using new list layouts alongside a details page, set `use_adv_search: 'true'` on the list view's tag to instantly apply detail page filters when linking back. (See below)
* Fixed missing parameter `range_field` for live Updates API
* Live Updates API now has a new version of its JavaScript file, with added functionality. This will be included in many new SiteBuilder layouts by default, or you can optionally upgrade your existing layouts with the tag:

```liquid
<script async src="{{'modules/module_86/js/v1-1/sitegurus_live_update_javascript_api.js' | asset_url }}"></script>
```

* Live Updates API now adds a click listener to text input fields. This helps to cover an edge-case where a cancel button is nested inside the text area to clear the field. Non-breaking change.
* New feature modifyHistory changes te URL to match fitlers without page reload - useful for shareable links and single-page applications
* New feature automatically launches a live-update on page load if any of the live-update form elemtns has a value.
* Improvement to error message when a Liquid error is detected in updated HTML.

#### 4.8.3 - Released 21st June <a href="#id-483-released-21st-june" id="id-483-released-21st-june"></a>

* Fixed a rare bug relating to module API page templates conflicting with site page templates.

#### 4.8.2 - Released 15th June <a href="#id-482-released-15th-june" id="id-482-released-15th-june"></a>

* Fix for live-updates issue where radio button element's value is read incorrectly when filtering.

#### 4.8.1 - Released 25th May <a href="#id-481-released-25th-may" id="id-481-released-25th-may"></a>

* Fix for issue from 4.7.2

#### 4.8.0 - Released 25th May <a href="#id-480-released-25th-may" id="id-480-released-25th-may"></a>

* Added layouts to Flowbite and Bootstrap Themes for:
  * Cookie Policy Popups
  * Cookie Policy Settings Pages
* These are examples of a brand new type of layout for SiteBuilder, as installing them creates a Siteglide code\_snippet with a unique ID. More \[code\_snippet layouts are now possible for SiteBuilder developers]\(/sitebuilder/extending-sitebuilder/adding-dynamic-layouts-to-themes-and-modules.md #code-snippets). Currently, these are not supported in PageBuilder.
* Page Template creation now gives you an option to install a cookie popup layout directly into your new Page Template. If chosen, this replaces the Google Analytics script which would normally be entered by default. The cookie popup layout contains the same Google Analytics script, but wraps it in logic which allows it to be toggled on and off by the end-user. Cookies settings page layouts are not designed to be entered in the Page Template and must be installed via the layouts tab instead.

#### 4.7.3 - Fix to previous release <a href="#id-473-fix-to-previous-release" id="id-473-fix-to-previous-release"></a>

#### 4.7.2 - Released 18th May 2023 <a href="#id-472-released-18th-may-2023" id="id-472-released-18th-may-2023"></a>

* Added new setting in settings tab for TinyMCE API key. This allows layouts to dynamically fetch key from one place.

#### 4.7.1 - Released 17th May 2023 <a href="#id-471-released-17th-may-2023" id="id-471-released-17th-may-2023"></a>

* Flowbite table webapp layout now uses left-align for its table headers.

#### 4.7.0 - Released 16th May 2023 <a href="#id-470-released-16th-may-2023" id="id-470-released-16th-may-2023"></a>

* Improvements to forms
  * All form components to use the `{{field_id}}` (plus any appropriate suffix) for their ID, instead of name (same for label for attributes). This should simplify any JS or CSS referencing it.
  * All required fields will have an asterisk " \*" added after their labels by default. This can be changed in components.
  * All inputs will be given data-attributes containing the text of their human-readable label `data-sg-validation-label` and the main field ID for their field `data-sg-validation-id` (note this may be different from the ID of the element if there are multiple form elements responsible for controlling a field, e.g. checkboxes). These can be useful when writing custom validation rules.
  * If the error message from Siteglide validation references a field by ID, we will change the error message to be more human-friendly. The default is a generic message asking the user to complete missing fields, but a commented out alternative allows you to print the human-readable name of the first missing field. Likewise, we've added a more human-friendly error message when a captcha fails. These messages can be edited in the form layout JS.
  * Improvements for Date, File and Image fields when marked as required.
  * Improvements for rich-text textarea type fields when marked as required.
  * Added minimum value to date fields so they do not add a date which is out of range of Siteglide's date field. Siteglide dates must be within the unix epoch.
  * Improved animation transition on form progress bars.

#### 4.6.5 - Released 11th May 2023 <a href="#id-465-released-11th-may-2023" id="id-465-released-11th-may-2023"></a>

* Improvement to Flowbite Login Form Modal Layout - Wider padding and more modern syntax to make it less prone to closing accidentally. This may still happen if the user clicks on the backdrop, but is less likely to happen when missing a click event aimed at an input.

#### 4.6.4 - Released 11th May 2023 <a href="#id-464-released-11th-may-2023" id="id-464-released-11th-may-2023"></a>

* Supporting the ability to more easily add a parameter to redirect the form to a custom URL. Set `custom_form_redirect` parameter on the top include `form` tag or the include `form_layout_fields` tag.
* Fixes for dark mode on some Flowbite Layouts

#### 4.6.3 - Released 27th April 2023 <a href="#id-463-released-27th-april-2023" id="id-463-released-27th-april-2023"></a>

#### 4.6.2 - Released 27th April 2023 <a href="#id-462-released-27th-april-2023" id="id-462-released-27th-april-2023"></a>

* Fix for Flowbite Typography dark mode on Flowbite Layouts
* Improvements and fixes to Sitebuilder Forms:
  * Type date fields now show initial values correctly, in local timezone, the same as Siteglide Admin. They also have max-values which don't allow invalid unix timestamps and expiry date will default to the max timestamp.
  * Textarea fields are now passed `data-sg-rich-text` attribute if `rich_text` is selected in the Siteglide Admin
  * Textarea fields now have rich-text-editor support when rich-text is turned on. This feature is powered by TinyMCE and requires a free API key to be added to remove warning notice. View the [docs](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/cloud-quick-start/#add-your-api-key) to add your API key and modify the settings.
* Added experimental support for datasources on Flowbite Live-updates WebApp table layout. This outputs the names of data-sourced webapp items in the table-cell instead of IDs. In future, we'd like to optimise this for performance, for now, we recommend only using it on short lists.

#### 4.6.1 - Released 26th April 2023 <a href="#id-461-released-26th-april-2023" id="id-461-released-26th-april-2023"></a>

* Improvements and Fixes for some Form Layouts

  * Flowbite multi-part forms now fill the container height, making it more convenient to add them inside a grid.

* Added a range of WebApp Layouts to the Flowbite Library.
* More WebApp Layouts coming soon.

* Support for WebApp and Module item add, edit and delete form layouts.
* Support for WebApp and Module item add forms to PageBuilder.
* Updated documentation to explain the new reliable way to change the order of custom fields in dynamic form layouts.

    It is possible to order custom fields so that they fall before, after or between these system fields.

* Improvements to Form Layout Image and File fields.
