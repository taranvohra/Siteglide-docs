# ðŸ“‹ Steps to Set Up CRM Sync on an Automation

The module is designed to require minimal code to set up- for many use cases, you only need to add a single line of code.

## Step 1) Setting up your API key <a href="#setting-up-your-api-key" id="setting-up-your-api-key"></a>

The first thing you will need to do to use this module is create an account with an e-marketing provider. For now, we only support Sendgrid, but please let us know if you have a feature request to support another. Please follow Sendgrid's own support for help getting this set up.

Once you're logged in, you need to create an API key.

The API key can be added to the module in the Siteglide Admin:

You're now ready to add some simple code.

#### Step 2) Create a Form with an Automation <a href="#the-liquid-include" id="the-liquid-include"></a>

It is probably simplest to choose Custom Action as the Automation type, or you could add the code on Step 3 to an existing email or API automation.

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [forms](../../../cms/forms/ "mention") and [automations](../../../cms/automations/ "mention") sections.
{% endhint %}

## Step 3) Include a Line of Liquid to Sync the Sumitted User Data to your CRM <a href="#the-liquid-include" id="the-liquid-include"></a>

### The Liquid include <a href="#the-liquid-include" id="the-liquid-include"></a>

The module provides you with Liquid code which, when run, carries out a range of actions using the details of the Siteglide CRM user who submitted the form and triggered the automation.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include 'modules/module_132/v1/crm_sync', marketing_provider: 'sendgrid', action: 'add' %}
{% endraw %}



```

#### Parameters <a href="#parameters" id="parameters"></a>

The following parameters can be used to modify behaviour:

**`marketing_provider`** _**required**_

At the moment, as we only support Sendgrid, this should be set to `sendgrid`. In future this may allow others to be selected.

**`action` - `add` or `update_if_added` or `remove`** _**required**_

This parameter controls essentially whether you wish the contact to be added or removed from the system, however, its behaviour is further modified by the `lists` parameter.

If the `lists` parameter is not included: `add` will add the contact to the marketing provider; `remove` will delete the contact from the e-marketing provider.

`update_if_added` is similar to `add`, but is designed for use-cases where you do not know if the user in question has given consent to receive marketing material. It will not create a new contact, but if a contact with that email address already exists, it will update custom fields to the latest Siteglide CRM data.

**`lists`**

Setting this parameter further modifies the behaviour of the previously discussed `action` parameter.

`lists` can be set to a comma-separated list of strings, where each string is an exact spelling to the name of a list in Sendgrid e.g.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include 'modules/module_132/v1/crm_sync', marketing_provider: 'sendgrid', action: 'add', lists: 'English Language Newsletter,Food and Recipes' %}
{% endraw %}


```

The above example will add the contact to both lists.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike custom-fields which are automatically synced to Sendgrid and created there, lists cannot be automatically created by the module API. They must be manually created in the Sendgrid portal first.
{% endhint %}

If the `lists` parameter is set: `add` will both add the contact and add them to all of the given lists. `remove` will remove the contact from all given lists, but _will not_ delete them as a contact.

If you do wish to delete the contact completely, remove the `lists` parameter.

**reserved\_fields**

The module automatically creates custom fields when you use the code to sync a contact, but Sendgrid also has "reserved fields" for storing data. The module will fill in some reserved fields automatically, like name and email address. But others will not be filled in automatically.

You can use the `reserved_fields` parameter to map Siteglide data into those reserved fields (optionally). To do this, first use the [parse\_json tag](https://documentation.platformos.com/api-reference/liquid/platformos-tags#parse-json) from platformOS or equivalent to create a liquid object, where the keys are exact matches for sendgrid reserved field names, and the values can be anything- hardcoded or dynamic Liquid data. Then pass the object in as the value of the parameter.

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% parse_json reserved_fields %}
  {
    "Address Line 1": "8 Tranquility Base",
    "Address Line 2": form.properties.form_field_3_2
  }
{% endparse_json %}
{% include "modules/module_132/v1/crm_sync", marketing_provider: "sendgrid", action: 'add', reserved_fields: reserved_fields %}
{% endraw %}



```

**`email`**

In most cases, adding the `email` parameter is unecessary as it will default to the value of `{{form.properties.email}}` which would be available inside a Siteglide automation for example.

However, if your use case requires running the code in a situation where this is not available, you can pass in the email address as a string instead:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% include "modules/module_132/v1/crm_sync", marketing_provider: "sendgrid", action: 'add', email: 'example@example.com' %}
{% endraw %}

```
